        </h2>
        <p class="lead text-1">Getting your bridal look spot-on is a dream for every Nigeria bride. You want a true Lehenga Makeup balance, without going overboard with your makeup palette. Here, we make the case for HD makeup and why you should opt for this much-talked-about makeup technique. HD or high definition makeup has been a familiar term for some time and you may have heard about it while watching a YouTube tutorial or maybe at beauty or cosmetic store. This makeup technique is an application technique of materials which enhance your best features while concealing your flaws against the amount of texture and volume that can be captured by today's wedding photographers and videographers. Though we all love those life-like pictures, the drawback of these technologies is that they are too clear, so much so, it’s almost impossible to hide blemishes, wrinkles, makeup breakouts on camera. It’s all visible on the screen and believe us, it does not look nice.</p>

          <h2><span class="text-muted ms-3"><strong>Mineral Makeup Look</strong></span>
          </h2>
          <p class="lead text-1">Mineral makeup is composed of, well, minerals. And not just any minerals, but naturally-derived ingredients that are good for your skin. Read on as we set the record straight and explain why our mineral makeup revolution has lasted for 25 years — and continues to grow. Mineral makeup has a lightweight appearance on the skin, which means it usually doesn’t look cakey or heavy. Mineral makeup gives the skin a subtle glow, creating a more youthful, healthy appearance. Mineral makeup in powder form often has a long shelf life because it doesn’t harbor bacteria the way other traditional powders do. True. Mineral makeup is good for all skin types, and that includes oily skin, as the natural minerals can absorb oils. Generally mineral foundations have a luminous finish due to the light-catching pigments used in the formulas, but if you prefer a matte finish you still have good-for-skin mineral options.</p>

        </h2>
        <p class="lead text-1">Cultural Makeup. Culture can be seen in art, religious or spiritual beliefs, systems of laws, or the customs that comprise the way a group functions. Human culture, under this definition, dates back at least 30,000 years and probably much further. The Paleolithic (or Old Stone Age) cultures of Europe hunted wild game and gathered plants. For instance Lebanese women like to buy foundation around two shades lighter than their skin color. People from Pakistan like that look as well. People who are from the Nigeria culture usually love makeup like us in the Nigeria Some of them even think that we do not wear enough in our culture, which I do not really understand how that is possible. Makeup is a very accepted part of the American culture. Many people love it and use it enhance their beauty. It all depends on the person of course, because some do not like it all. However, the modern makeup culture is beginning to evolve in ways that must be embraced. Cosmetics are, in fact, becoming an ever-growing genre of art. Thus, this article will analyze the current makeup culture, and reconsider cosmetics as a new art form.</p>

        <h2><span class="text-muted ms-3"><strong>Ankara Gele</strong></span>
        </h2>
        <p class="lead text-1">Ankara fabric is the one of the most common type of African fabrics throughout the continent and is characterized by having bold colors and designs. It may also be referred to as African Prints, Wax Prints, Dutch Wax, Kitenge and Shweshwe among many other names. Both men and women use ankara fabrics to sew any type of outfit they desire. Sometimes, for occasion-wear, Nigerian men wear ankara outfits with the traditional men’s hat ( fila) while women wear ankara outfits with statement bead necklaces and traditional headgear (gele) or ankara turban headwrap. It’s common to see ankara materials combined with other types of fabrics to give the outfit a kind of different vibe. So, we have all sorts of ankara mix, such as ankara mixed with lace material, ankara mixed with chiffon, ankara mixed with plain materials, and ankara mixed with denim or even jersey (aka t-shirt material). <br>Create initial pleats: Before you place the Gele fabric on your head, create some pleats. You do that by using each hand to hold each end of the ankara fabric, then making a few pleats, one by one. Continue until you have about 10 pleats. At this point you should still have some parts of the fabric without pleats.</p>
